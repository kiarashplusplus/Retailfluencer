Retailfluencer
The Attribution Layer for Influencer-Driven Retail Sales
Overview

Storefluence is a SaaS platform that enables brands to track, scale, and automate influencer-driven in-store sales using digital 8112 coupons, attribution logic, and post-purchase affiliate loops.

Think:
Klaviyo + Social Snowball + Retail Coupons

…but built specifically for Target, Walmart, Kroger, CVS, and other large retail chains.

Our goal is not to replace influencer platforms — it’s to become the infrastructure layer that connects influencers, coupons, and retail attribution.

The Problem
1. Retail Has No Attribution

Brands spend millions on:

Influencer marketing

In-store promotions

Coupon campaigns

But they can’t connect:

Who promoted the product

Who actually bought it

What content worked

What ROI was generated

Retail sales are largely a black box.

2. Influencer Marketing Stops at the Link

Influencer tools today:

Track clicks

Track ecommerce purchases

Stop at the website

They don’t work for in-store purchases, which is where most CPG revenue still happens.

3. Coupon Systems Are Blind

8112 coupons:

Work at scale

Are trusted by retailers

Already used by brands

But:

They don’t attribute sales to creators

They don’t capture customer data

They don’t create repeat buyers

The Solution: Retailfluencer

Storefluence connects influencer marketing, retail coupons, and email-based growth into one system.

At a high level:

Influencers promote a product

Followers redeem a digital 8112 coupon in-store

The purchase is attributed to the influencer

The buyer is invited to join as an affiliate

The system repeats and scales automatically

This creates a social snowball effect, but for physical retail.

What Storefluence Is (and Is Not)
✅ What It Is

A coupon + attribution engine

A post-purchase growth platform

A retail-focused affiliate system

A data layer between brands and stores

❌ What It Is Not

Not an influencer discovery platform

Not a CRM

Not a marketplace

Not a competitor to Ampifi, Modash, or Upfluence

Instead, we integrate with those tools.

How It Works
1. Influencer Activation

Influencers are sourced via:

Existing platforms (Ampifi, Modash, etc.)

Agencies

Internal brand teams

Each influencer receives:

A unique digital 8112 coupon

A tracking link or QR code

Attribution tied to their identity

2. In-Store Redemption

A customer:

Sees influencer content

Goes to a physical store

Uses the coupon at checkout

The system records:

Coupon redemption

Location

Timestamp

Associated influencer

3. Post-Purchase Automation

After redemption:

Customer receives an email or SMS

They’re invited to:

Join the brand’s deal list

Become an affiliate

Share their own link or coupon

This turns:
Buyer → Promoter → Distributor

4. The Snowball Effect

Every new buyer can:

Generate more buyers

Create more content

Expand reach organically

Over time:

CAC decreases

Attribution improves

Brands build owned audiences

Why This Is Valuable
For Brands

Real influencer-to-sale attribution

Email list growth from retail

Lower CAC over time

Faster product testing

Measurable ROI

For Influencers

Easy monetization

No storefront required

Works with existing content

Passive earnings from coupons

For Retail

Works with existing coupon systems
