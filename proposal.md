Hey Kiarash,

Ever since our chat, I've been itching on this idea. I've made concepts on this vision, but the CEO of Ampifi, Shawn, just doesn't really seem to care to pursue this because he's so focused on Ampifi and the creator platform. This has all been my idea and my vision for a SaaS that allows CPG and retail brands to create attributable influencer marketing. Again, hardly anyone is doing this, but I've attended the "Expo West" trade show for the past 2 years, and it's the largest retail trade show for CPG and retail brands to get into retailers to sell them. While at these shows, I've done a product market fit survey and asked them if retail attributable influencer marketing is something they see value in and would pay money for, and they have said far and away yes. like i would say 95% of them are interested and the other 5% only werent interested because they didnt have the time to really chat with me on what i was really looking to create because they were at the show to get into retail shops. Every founder or owner in the space sees that social media is the future, but that storefront sales are still where the bulk of the money comes from on these CPG and retail products, so if we can connect the benefits of e-commerce to the storefronts through this system, there's so much power. i used chat to basically design my concept for you below. Let me know the big picture if you think building this is possible. Also check out https://www.socialsnowball.io/. They sold for 30 million this year, and they are similar to this idea, only it's the snowball effect for e-commerce, but nobody has created anything successfully for retail yet. there are things kind of close to this like levanta.io who does influencer marketing for walmarts online app but again thats for online and brands want attributable tech in the store so they can truly see which influencer preform the best because right now its like gambling if an influencer will drive sales to a store so only the largest brands are doing it and they have no suscess attribution to it. the other huge value add is that if we build this the 8112 coupons are already in target, walmart and cvs so i can imediatly gtm on any of the products in those stores and get them to sign up for this. Then, the down the road phase would be that we target smaller retail chains, get them to participate in 8112, and then sell all the same products in their store. I love how strong a channel this is as well as far as retention goes. brands won't want to quit this because they will want those analytics from influencers' posts and the customers they got from the influencers as well. And as stores get added, they get even stickier. As brands we are already partnered with in Target, getting into a retail chain in Texas like HEB, we can use this as leverage for HEB to get 8112 coupons and then get help for this new brand with their launch into the new region. and so on and so forth. 

Anyway, im just trying to get you to fully understand the value here. Here's the overall ux and product vision. There's an image that shows all the tabs the platform would need and the steps on how we would create this and what the workflow would look like.
